# New-Year-project
This project creates a New Year Countdown using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The countdown updates every second with setInterval. A preview button displays a "Happy New Year" GIF when clicked. The layout uses flexbox and CSS for styling, including hover effects on buttons for better interaction.
