# New-Year-project
This project creates a New Year Countdown using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The countdown updates every second, displaying the remaining time until New Year's Eve. I used JavaScriptâ€™s Date object to calculate the remaining time and implemented a function, updateCounter, which updates the display every 1000 milliseconds using setInterval.

The project also features a preview button that shows a "Happy New Year" GIF in the left-bottom corner when clicked. This functionality is controlled using a showPreview function and DOM manipulation, with simple if-else logic to toggle the visibility of the GIF.

In terms of layout, the HTML structure uses flexbox and nested flexbox to arrange the elements neatly. I added input fields and buttons, and used CSS to style the text, background, and buttons, including hover effects with smooth color transitions for better user interaction.
